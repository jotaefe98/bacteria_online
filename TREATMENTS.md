## Selection Logic Summary

| Treatment     | Organs Needed | Player Restrictions | Special Notes                 |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Transplant    | 2             | Different players   | Both organs shown as selected |
| Organ Thief   | 1             | Not current player  | Clear "steal" visual          |
| Contagion     | 0             | N/A                 | Automatic targeting           |
| Latex Glove   | 0             | N/A                 | Affects all others            |
| Medical Error | 1             | Not current player  | Body swap indicator           |

## Notifications

### Toast Notifications

- **Organ Stolen**: "Player X stole your Y organ!"
- **Hand Discarded**: "Player X used Latex Glove - all your cards were discarded!"
- **Organ Transplanted**: "Player X transplanted your Y organ with Player Z's W organ"
- **Medical Error**: "Player X swapped bodies with you!"
- **Contagion**: "Player X spread a virus to your Y organ!"

### Error Messages

- **Invalid Selection**: Appropriate message for each treatment type
- **No Valid Targets**: "No valid targets for this treatment"
- **Selection Required**: "Must select [number] organ(s) to use this treatment"

## Technical Implementation

### Client-Side Validation

```typescript
// In handleOrganClick
if (selectedCard?.type === "treatment") {
  switch (selectedCard.color) {
    case "red": // transplant - needs 2 organs from different players
    case "green": // organ thief - needs 1 organ from other player
    case "rainbow": // medical error - needs 1 organ from other player
    case "blue": // contagion - no selection needed
    case "yellow": // latex glove - no selection needed
  }
}
```

### Server-Side Logic

```typescript
// In applyTreatmentEffect
switch (card.color) {
  case "red":
    return applyTransplant(allBoards, currentPlayerId, action);
  case "green":
    return applyOrganThief(allBoards, currentPlayerId, action);
  case "blue":
    return applyContagion(allBoards, currentPlayerId);
  case "yellow":
    return applyLatexGlove();
  case "rainbow":
    return applyMedicalError(allBoards, currentPlayerId, action);
}
```

## Card Deck Mapping

- Red Treatment Cards ‚Üí Transplant
- Green Treatment Cards ‚Üí Organ Thief
- Blue Treatment Cards ‚Üí Contagion
- Yellow Treatment Cards ‚Üí Latex Glove
- Rainbow Treatment Cards ‚Üí Medical Error

This mapping allows the system to determine treatment type by card color while maintaining the visual card design.
