# üêõ Bug Fixes - Bacteria Online

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fixed Organ Color Duplication Error**

**Problem**: The game was incorrectly preventing players from placing organs when they didn't have duplicate colors.

**Root Cause**: The `canPlayCard` function was not properly handling the rainbow3. ‚úÖ **Immediate Victory**: Fixed delayed victory check after organ theft/transplant 4. ‚úÖ **Contagion Validation**: Fixed contagion card playable without valid targets 5. ‚úÖ **Duplicate Card Removal**: Fixed wrong card being removed when playing cards 6. ‚úÖ **Organ Exchange Sync**: Fixed client/server desync after organ exchangesgan logic and was too restrictive.

**Fix**:

- Enhanced the organ placement validation in `canPlayCard` function
- Added proper handling for rainbow organs (can place multiple rainbow organs)
- Added a maximum of 4 organs per player limit

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/functions/gameLogic.ts` - Lines 57-78

### 2. **Fixed Victory Condition Not Triggering**

**Problem**: Players with 4 healthy organs of different colors (including rainbow and immunized organs) were not winning.

**Root Cause**: The `checkWinCondition` function had flawed logic for counting rainbow organs and determining unique colors.

**Fix**:

- Completely rewrote the victory condition logic
- Improved rainbow organ counting system
- Added proper color assignment for rainbow organs to fill missing colors
- Enhanced debugging logs for better troubleshooting

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/functions/gameLogic.ts` - Lines 573-618

### 3. **Fixed Delayed Victory Check After Organ Theft**

**Problem**: Victory condition was only checked at the end of the turn, not immediately after playing a card (especially organ theft).

**Root Cause**: The game was checking victory condition after all card effects and phase changes, causing a delay.

**Fix**:

- Moved victory condition check to immediately after applying card effects
- Added immediate victory check after treatment effects (organ theft, transplant, etc.)
- Removed duplicate victory checks to avoid race conditions

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/events/registerGameEvents.ts` - Lines 285-320 and 490-520

### 4. **Fixed Contagion Card Playable Without Valid Targets**

**Problem**: The contagion card could be played even when there were no valid targets to transmit bacteria to other players.

**Root Cause**: The game was only checking if the player had infected organs, not if there were valid targets for transmission.

**Fix**:

- Added comprehensive validation for treatment cards with new `canPlayTreatment` function
- Created `canPlayContagion` helper function to check for valid targets
- Enhanced treatment card validation to check all requirements before allowing play
- Added proper error messages for different failure scenarios

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/functions/gameLogic.ts` - Lines 16-71 (new functions) and 179-251 (canPlayTreatment)
- `server/src/events/registerGameEvents.ts` - Lines 14 and 261-273 (import and validation logic)

### 5. **Fixed Duplicate Card Removal Bug**

**Problem**: When playing a card, sometimes a different card was being removed from the hand instead of the selected card.

**Root Cause**: The card removal logic was being executed twice in the same event handler - once after applying the card effect and once more later in the same function, causing the wrong card to be removed on the second execution.

**Fix**:

- Removed duplicate `splice` operation in the `play-card` event handler
- Added debug logging to identify the issue (later removed)
- Ensured card removal happens only once per play action

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/events/registerGameEvents.ts` - Lines 430-435 (removed duplicate splice)

### 6. **Fixed Organ Exchange Synchronization Bug**

**Problem**: After organ exchanges (transplant/organ thief), the client state was not properly synchronized with the server, causing validation errors when trying to play cards on organs.

**Root Cause**: The organ exchange logic was using color keys incorrectly, not properly mapping organs to their actual colors after exchange operations.

**Fix**:

- Fixed `applyTransplant` to properly delete and re-add organs using their actual colors
- Fixed `applyOrganThief` to use the organ's actual color for duplicate checking and placement
- Ensured proper mapping between organ colors and board positions

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/functions/gameLogic.ts` - Lines 487-495 (transplant fix) and 542-550 (organ thief fix)

**Technical Details**:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Bug): Using action color keys
thiefBoard.organs[action.targetOrganColor] = organToSteal;
firstBoard.organs[action.targetOrganColor] =
  secondBoard.organs[action.secondTargetOrganColor];

// AFTER (Fixed): Using actual organ colors
thiefBoard.organs[organToSteal.organ.color] = organToSteal;
firstBoard.organs[secondOrganData.organ.color] = secondOrganData;
```

**Test Case**:

- **Setup**: Player A has green organ, Player B has yellow organ
- **Action**: Player C plays transplant to exchange Player A's green with Player B's yellow
- **Expected**: Player A now has yellow organ, Player B has green organ ‚úÖ
- **Previous**: Player A thought they still had green organ (client/server desync) ‚ùå

## Technical Details

### Victory Condition Algorithm (New)

```typescript
// 1. Filter healthy organs (healthy, vaccinated, immunized)
const healthyOrgans = organs.filter(
  (organ) =>
    organ.status === "healthy" ||
    organ.status === "vaccinated" ||
    organ.status === "immunized"
);

// 2. Count regular colors and rainbow organs separately
const colors = new Set<string>();
let rainbowCount = 0;

for (const organ of healthyOrgans) {
  if (organ.organ.color === "rainbow") {
    rainbowCount++;
  } else {
    colors.add(organ.organ.color);
  }
}

// 3. Use rainbow organs to fill missing colors
const missingColors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"].filter(
  (color) => !colors.has(color)
);
const colorsToFill = Math.min(rainbowCount, missingColors.length);
const totalUniqueColors = colors.size + colorsToFill;

// 4. Victory if 4 or more unique colors
return totalUniqueColors >= 4;
```

### Contagion Validation Algorithm (New)

```typescript
// 1. Check if player has infected organs
const infectedOrgans = Object.entries(currentBoard.organs).filter(
  ([_, organ]) => organ.bacteria.length > 0
);

if (infectedOrgans.length === 0) {
  return { canPlay: false, reason: "You have no infected organs to spread" };
}

// 2. For each infected organ, check if it can spread to any other player
for (const [organColor, organState] of infectedOrgans) {
  const hasValidTargets = otherPlayerIds.some((playerId) => {
    const targetBoard = allBoards[playerId];

    // 3. Look for compatible organs that are healthy and free
    const compatibleOrgans = Object.entries(targetBoard.organs).filter(
      ([targetColor, targetOrgan]) => {
        const isColorCompatible =
          targetColor === organColor ||
          targetColor === "rainbow" ||
          organColor === "rainbow";
        const isFree =
          targetOrgan.status === "healthy" &&
          targetOrgan.bacteria.length === 0 &&
          targetOrgan.medicines.length === 0;
        return isColorCompatible && isFree;
      }
    );
    return compatibleOrgans.length > 0;
  });

  if (hasValidTargets) {
    return { canPlay: true };
  }
}

// 4. If no valid targets found for any infected organ
return { canPlay: false, reason: "No valid targets available for contagion" };
```

### Card Play Flow (Updated)

```typescript
// 1. Validate card can be played
const canPlay = canPlayCard(card, playerBoard, targetBoard, targetOrgan);

// 2. Apply card effect
const result = applyCardEffect(
  card,
  playerBoard,
  targetBoard,
  targetOrgan,
  allBoards
);

// 3. Remove card from hand
removeCardFromHand(playerId, cardId);

// 4. Recalculate organ statuses
recalculateOrganStatuses(allBoards);

// 5. ‚úÖ CHECK VICTORY IMMEDIATELY
if (checkWinCondition(playerBoard)) {
  declareWinner(playerId);
  return;
}

// 6. Continue with phase changes
```
