# üêõ Bug Fixes - Bacteria Online

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Fixed Organ Color Duplication Error**

**Problem**: The game was incorrectly preventing players from placing organs when they didn't have duplicate colors.

**Root Cause**: The `canPlayCard` function was not properly handling the rainbow organ logic and was too restrictive.

**Fix**:

- Enhanced the organ placement validation in `canPlayCard` function
- Added proper handling for rainbow organs (can place multiple rainbow organs)
- Added a maximum of 4 organs per player limit

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/functions/gameLogic.ts` - Lines 57-78

### 2. **Fixed Victory Condition Not Triggering**

**Problem**: Players with 4 healthy organs of different colors (including rainbow and immunized organs) were not winning.

**Root Cause**: The `checkWinCondition` function had flawed logic for counting rainbow organs and determining unique colors.

**Fix**:

- Completely rewrote the victory condition logic
- Improved rainbow organ counting system
- Added proper color assignment for rainbow organs to fill missing colors
- Enhanced debugging logs for better troubleshooting

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/functions/gameLogic.ts` - Lines 573-618

### 3. **Fixed Delayed Victory Check After Organ Theft**

**Problem**: Victory condition was only checked at the end of the turn, not immediately after playing a card (especially organ theft).

**Root Cause**: The game was checking victory condition after all card effects and phase changes, causing a delay.

**Fix**:

- Moved victory condition check to immediately after applying card effects
- Added immediate victory check after treatment effects (organ theft, transplant, etc.)
- Removed duplicate victory checks to avoid race conditions

**Files Modified**:

- `server/src/events/registerGameEvents.ts` - Lines 285-320 and 490-520

## Technical Details

### Victory Condition Algorithm (New)

```typescript
// 1. Filter healthy organs (healthy, vaccinated, immunized)
const healthyOrgans = organs.filter(
  (organ) =>
    organ.status === "healthy" ||
    organ.status === "vaccinated" ||
    organ.status === "immunized"
);

// 2. Count regular colors and rainbow organs separately
const colors = new Set<string>();
let rainbowCount = 0;

for (const organ of healthyOrgans) {
  if (organ.organ.color === "rainbow") {
    rainbowCount++;
  } else {
    colors.add(organ.organ.color);
  }
}

// 3. Use rainbow organs to fill missing colors
const missingColors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow"].filter(
  (color) => !colors.has(color)
);
const colorsToFill = Math.min(rainbowCount, missingColors.length);
const totalUniqueColors = colors.size + colorsToFill;

// 4. Victory if 4 or more unique colors
return totalUniqueColors >= 4;
```

### Card Play Flow (Updated)

```typescript
// 1. Validate card can be played
const canPlay = canPlayCard(card, playerBoard, targetBoard, targetOrgan);

// 2. Apply card effect
const result = applyCardEffect(
  card,
  playerBoard,
  targetBoard,
  targetOrgan,
  allBoards
);

// 3. Remove card from hand
removeCardFromHand(playerId, cardId);

// 4. Recalculate organ statuses
recalculateOrganStatuses(allBoards);

// 5. ‚úÖ CHECK VICTORY IMMEDIATELY
if (checkWinCondition(playerBoard)) {
  declareWinner(playerId);
  return;
}

// 6. Continue with phase changes
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Test Case 1: Organ Color Validation

- **Setup**: Player has red, green, blue organs
- **Action**: Try to place yellow organ
- **Expected**: Should be allowed ‚úÖ
- **Previous**: Was incorrectly blocked ‚ùå

### Test Case 2: Victory with Mixed Organs

- **Setup**: Player has red (healthy), green (vaccinated), blue (immunized), rainbow (healthy)
- **Action**: Check victory condition
- **Expected**: Should win (4 different colors) ‚úÖ
- **Previous**: Didn't win due to rainbow counting bug ‚ùå

### Test Case 3: Immediate Victory After Organ Theft

- **Setup**: Player has 3 healthy organs, steals 4th organ of different color
- **Action**: Play organ thief card
- **Expected**: Should win immediately ‚úÖ
- **Previous**: Had to wait until next turn ‚ùå

## Breaking Changes

None - all fixes are backwards compatible.

## Performance Impact

- Victory condition check is now more efficient
- Reduced duplicate validation calls
- Better memory usage with improved Set operations

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for victory condition edge cases
2. Implement game state validation middleware
3. Add performance monitoring for card play operations
4. Consider adding animation delays for better UX during immediate victories
